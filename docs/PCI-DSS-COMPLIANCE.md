# PCI DSS Compliance Checklist

This document outlines the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements applicable to our mobile finance application and implementation status.

## Scope

This application processes payment card information and therefore requires PCI DSS compliance. We implement a tokenization approach where:

1. Card details are captured in the app
2. Card details are immediately tokenized
3. Only tokens are stored in our database
4. The original card data is never stored in our systems

## Requirement Status

| # | Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|---|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Install and maintain a firewall configuration | âœ… Implemented | Using cloud provider's firewall and WAF |
| 2 | Do not use vendor-supplied defaults | âœ… Implemented | All default credentials changed, unused services disabled |
| 3 | Protect stored cardholder data | âœ… Implemented | Tokenization implemented in `tokenization.ts` |
| 4 | Encrypt transmission of cardholder data | âœ… Implemented | TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning in `network_security_config.xml` |
| 5 | Use and regularly update anti-malware | âœ… Implemented | Server systems use updated anti-malware |
| 6 | Develop and maintain secure systems | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Implementing security testing (SAST/DAST) |
| 7 | Restrict access to cardholder data | âœ… Implemented | Role-based access control in `authMiddleware.js` |
| 8 | Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access | âœ… Implemented | Unique Firebase Auth UIDs for all users |
| 9 | Restrict physical access to cardholder data | âœ… Implemented | Cloud hosting with physical security controls |
| 10 | Track and monitor all access to network resources | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Implementing comprehensive logging |
| 11 | Regularly test security systems and processes | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Setting up automated security testing |
| 12 | Maintain an information security policy | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Drafting security policies and procedures |

## Implementation Details

### Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data

We implement tokenization for all card data using the following approach:

```javascript
// From services/tokenization.ts
export const tokenize = async (sensitiveData: string): Promise<string> => {
  // Convert sensitive data to a token via secure API call
  // The actual implementation uses encryption and secure APIs
  // NEVER store the original data, only the token
};
```

### Requirement 4: Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data

We use TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning for all API communications:

1. Android: Certificate pinning in `network_security_config.xml`
2. iOS: Certificate pinning in network requests
3. All API endpoints require HTTPS

### Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems

1. Regular security testing via Jest tests in `__tests__/security/`
2. SAST using Checkmarx
3. DAST using OWASP ZAP
4. Regular security patches for all dependencies

## Annual Assessment Plan

1. **Q1**: Internal security assessment
2. **Q2**: Vulnerability scanning
3. **Q3**: Penetration testing by third party
4. **Q4**: PCI DSS formal assessment
